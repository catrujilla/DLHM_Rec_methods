# DLHM_Rec_methods
Repository for code implementation of novel and/or alternative reconstruction methods in Digital Lenless Holographic microscopy (DLHM).

During 2023-1 semester, this rep will allow code implementaion to Eng. student Tomás Vélez in his advanced project course named "Numerical reconstruction in lensless holographic microscopy: Implementation and validation of discrete optical wavefield propagators.".
