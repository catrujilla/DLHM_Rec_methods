# DLHM_Rec_methods
Repository for code implementation of novel and/or alternative reconstruction methods in Digital Lenless Holographic microscopy (DLHM).

During 2023-1 semester, this rep will allow code implementaion to Eng. student Tomás Vélez in his advanced project course named "Numerical reconstruction in lensless holographic microscopy: Implementation and validation of discrete optical wavefield propagators.".

What can you find in this repository:
- Implementation of a novel modification of the Angular Spectrum Methode called 'Semi Analyticall Angular Spectrum Method' (SAASM). More details about the theoretical background inside the code.
- Implementation of the First Raileygh Sommerfeld diffraction integral without approximations.
- A detailed guide of how to install Pycuda in windows with the proper dependencies.
- A solver that optimizes the computational complexity of the RS1 in terms of the output sampling, to find the least demanding sampling that satisfies Nyquist-Shannon theorem.
- Same implementation of the RS1 but runing in GPU using pycuda library (Under development).
